# DARE
Danny's Awesome Rendering Engine.

## Organization
This project is divided into **DAGAL** (Danny's Awesome Graphics Abstraction Layer) and DARE itself.

`DAGAL` abstracts certain verbose parts of the Vulkan API away.

`DARE` makes use of `DAGAL` for graphics and is the actual application itself.
